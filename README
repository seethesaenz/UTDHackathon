Inspiration: 
For a first-time homebuyer, navigating the process, filled with new terminology, and seeing if you qualify for a loan is oftentimes confusing and difficult.

If they don’t qualify, without knowing why and what they can do about it, many people are left stuck.

Solution:
Leveraging AI technologies, our Prospective Homebuyer Portal guides the user through the process of applying for a mortgage, explaining the steps as well as offering custom solutions tailored specifically to the customer’s needs.

In addition, the portal allows for an innovative dashboard, created from a custom .csv file uploaded by the user. This dashboard automatically calculates and generates visualizations for the most important points.

An integrated chatbot designed to answer questions related to the topic helps address customer concerns that is not done elsewhere.
